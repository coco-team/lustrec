* TODO refactoring + doc
- separate lustre types from machine types in different files
- split basic libs into backend specific files
- define mli for core steps: normalization and machine code
- define mli for lustre_type and machine_type (Garion)

* TODO
** include files
** main function
*** add a clean test to forbid array arguments for main node
    (no available input/output methods)
** test suite
*** for complex dependency graphs (notably mem/mem cyclic dependencies)
*** for clocks
*** for arrays (non-generic nodes)
** compare with lus2c (verimag)
** extension
*** array access: done
*** add an option to dynamically check array accesses: done
*** power operator: done
*** automaton
*** annotations to ACSL
** init checking
*** to be done !!!
** normalization
*** sub-expression sharing seems to be not totally working: fixed
*** improve behavior for power and access operators:done
*** more type-directed normalization (notably to improve code gen for arrays): done
*** reuse of dead vars instead of systematically allocating new local vars
*** add a clean test for used but undefined nodes
** typing
*** correct typing of arith ops (real/int with subtyping ?)
*** display array dimensions with correct names: done
*** clocks must not be static inputs: done
** clock calculus
*** extension from named clocks to valued clocks ?
*** static inputs should be polymorphic, as global constants are: done

* Horn backend
** enum types for automaton
   - issues with MBranches and clocks
     - control-on-clock generates a "if cond then expr else nothing
     - it has to be expressed in a functional way to enable its expression as
       horn


-  The issue seems mainly to lie in the out = f(in) every cond
   this generates the follwoingg imperative statements
   if cond then f_reset(*mem) else {(nothing, ie. not reset)}
   f_step(in,*put,*mem)

   In the machine code, this is done by generating the sequence of 2 instructions
   1. if cond then MReset() else {}  (* creation of a conditional statement *)
   2. MStep()

- For Xavier: Syntactically, how could you "reset" an arrow? When we see an
  Expr_arrow, we introduce a MReset instance to the set of instruction on the
  reset function of the current node, but is there any mean to do it with
  "every" ?




x = expr when c

if c then
  x= expr

else {}

x = if c then expr else x
